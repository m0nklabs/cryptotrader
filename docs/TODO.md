# TODO (Feature Backlog & Roadmap)

This document tracks the v2 implementation backlog, priorities, and the path toward the **North Star** goal.

> **See also**: [FEATURES.md](FEATURES.md) for detailed feature documentation.
> **See also**: [ROADMAP_V2.md](ROADMAP_V2.md) for the comprehensive roadmap organized by epics.

## 🌟 North Star Goal

**Build a semi-autonomous trading machine that generates consistent profit (PnL).**

The primary metric of success is **profitability**, not just features or code quality. Every new feature must contribute to:

1. **Profit Generation**: Signal quality, execution precision, cost minimization.
2. **Risk Control**: Position sizing, exposure limits, drawdown protection.
3. **Observability**: Real-time transparency into decisions and performance.

### Key Principles

- **Profit > Features**: Prioritize features that directly impact PnL.
- **Paper trading by default**: All execution code defaults to `dry_run=True`.
- **Transparency**: Every decision must be explainable and auditable.
- **Safety first**: Human supervision for large trades or strategy changes.

---

## Constraints

- Default to paper-trading / dry-run.
- Keep secrets out of git.
- DEX/swaps/bridges/tokenomics are out of scope.

---

## 🎯 Strategic Priorities (Ordered by Impact)

### Priority 1: Prove Profitability (Backtesting)
> Issue #135 — **CRITICAL**

Before going live, we must validate that strategies can generate profit:
- ⏳ Backtesting framework with historical data replay
- ⏳ Strategy performance metrics (Sharpe, max drawdown, win rate)
- ⏳ Walk-forward analysis support

### Priority 2: Live Execution

Enable real trading (with human oversight):
- ⏳ Bitfinex live adapter (schema ready, implementation pending)
- ⏳ Multi-exchange support (Issue #131 — Binance/KuCoin adapters)
- ⏳ Trade confirmation flow (human approval for large trades)

### Priority 3: AI-Enhanced Scoring

Leverage LLMs for qualitative analysis:
- ⏳ LLM integration (Ollama for local, OpenAI/Anthropic via API)
- ⏳ AI-based opportunity scoring with reasoning
- ⏳ Sentiment analysis from LLM context

### Priority 4: Frontend Observability

Real-time transparency into the trading system:
- ⏳ Wallet/Portfolio overview (balances, positions, PnL)
- ⏳ Opportunity Explorer (sorted by quality, click to visualize)
- ⏳ Multi-timeframe visualization on charts
- ⏳ Indicator overlays (RSI, MACD, Bollinger on price chart)
- ⏳ Visual price projections/forecasts
